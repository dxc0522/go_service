# Pen

pen is used to draw lines, 
it currently contains three functionality.

* server side codegen from openapi yaml
* client side codegen from openapi yaml
* generate migration files from db

## Use

### Method1(suggested): 

```
go env -w GOPROXY=https://arf.tesla.cn/artifactory/api/go/gfsh-sdk-go-virtual,https://goproxy.cn,direct
go env -w GONOSUMDB=*.teslamotors.com,*.tesla.cn

go get -u -v github.com/go_service/internal/pen
```

### Method2(cutting edge version): 

following this [instruction](https://golang.org/doc/faq#git_https)

* `go env -w GOPRIVATE="*.tesla.*"`
* `machine github.tesla.cn login {UserName} password {PersonalAccessToken}` INTO `~/.netrc`

Note: the PersonalAccessToken can be created [here](https://github.tesla.cn/settings/tokens)

## .pen suffix

Files have `.pen` suffix in the name is a type of file that should not be changed by user.

It will be override automatically by `pen` command,

If you really wants change it, please remove the `.pen` part,

then `pen` will know this file is out of auto generation.

It will not try to the corresponding `.pen` file.
